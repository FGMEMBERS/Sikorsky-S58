All credit goes to those who put this superb aircraft together from nothing.

I have only attempted to make it easier to fly by adding some modified instruments
to the panel, hopefully making it less of a handful to fly.

aileron + elevator cyclic trim (C130-trim) instruments have white dots on them. 

Simply point the needles at the dots, then when the engine RPM reaches 100% you can 
wind the collective/throttle up to the white line on the ENG TRQ instrument.

You will now be airborne and fairly stable.
TRIM-AS-YOU-FLY is the golden rule.

Avoid big sudden increases or decreases in power until you are familiar with her handling
characteristics.

Other than that I can only say that I love the way the airframe vibrates like the real thing.

 Superb Sim.
If anyone finds an old picture of one of these birds I would like to have a go at doing a
proper livery for it (Military).

Have fun....Regards Slowman.
